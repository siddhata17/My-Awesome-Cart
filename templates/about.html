      <p>           My Awesome Cart is an Indian e-commerce company based in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India. It was founded by Siddhata Brijesh Sarnaik in 2020. The company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials & groceries, and lifestyle products.

The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.  My Awesome Cart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.</p>
